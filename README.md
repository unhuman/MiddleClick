<h2 align="right">:mag: Usage</h2>

<blockquote align="right">

It's more than just `⌘`+click

</blockquote>

<p align="right">

`System-wide` · close tabs by middleclicking on them

</p>

<p align="right">

`In Safari` · middleclicking on a link opens it in the background as a new tab

</p>

<p align="right">

`In Terminal` · paste selected text

</p>

<br>

## Install

```ps1
make build-release
```

<br>

## Preferences

### Hide Status Bar Item

> This is a native macOS feature — works the same for any app.

1. Hold `⌘` and drag the icon away from the menu bar until you see :heavy_multiplication_x:
2. Release

To bring it back — just open MiddleClick again while it's already running.

### Number of Fingers

- Want to use 4, 5 or 2 fingers for middleclicking? No trouble. Even 10 is possible.
- **Note:** setting `fingers` to `2` will conflict with normal two-finger right-clicks and single-finger clicks.

```ps1
defaults write com.unhuman.MiddleClick fingers 4
```

> Default is 3

### Allow to click with more than the defined number of fingers.

- This is useful if your second hand accidentally touches the touchpad.
- Unfortunately, this does not serve as a palm rejection technique for huge touchpads.

```ps1
defaults write com.unhuman.MiddleClick allowMoreFingers true
```

> Default is false, so that the number of fingers is precise

### Tapping preferences

#### Max Distance Delta

- The maximum distance the cursor can travel between touch and release for a tap to be considered valid.
- The position is normalized and values go from 0 to 1.

```ps1
defaults write com.unhuman.MiddleClick maxDistanceDelta 0.03
```

> Default is 0.05

#### Max Time Delta

- The maximum interval in milliseconds between touch and release for a tap to be considered valid.

```ps1
defaults write com.unhuman.MiddleClick maxTimeDelta 150
```

> Default is 300

## Troubleshooting

- [Accessibility permissions not working after an update](./docs/troubleshooting.md#accessibility-permissions-not-working-after-an-update)
- [Antivirus / CleanMyMac false positive](./docs/troubleshooting.md#antivirus--cleanmymac-flags-middleclick-as-adware)
- [Three Finger Drag conflicts](./docs/three-finger-drag.md)

## Building from source

> Assuming you have `Command Line Tools` installed

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `make`
3. You'll get a `MiddleClick.app` in `./build/`

### Local release build (no certificate required)

To build a Release-configuration binary locally without a Developer ID certificate:

```ps1
make build-release
```

This produces an unsigned `MiddleClick.app` in `./build/`. Note: unsigned builds cannot be distributed and macOS Gatekeeper will block them on other machines.
